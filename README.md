# 🚀 Real-Time Fraud Detection & Analytics System

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a real-time fraud detection system using **Python, MySQL, and Power BI**.
It generates large-scale transaction data, applies both **rule-based** and **machine learning models**, and visualizes fraud insights through an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Financial systems need to detect fraudulent transactions quickly while maintaining a low false positive rate.
This project demonstrates how **data pipelines, analytics, and machine learning** can be combined to identify suspicious activity.
